This project takes the scraped text from web articles and performs text classification and sentiment analysis related to ESG characteristics. 
Text is classified as either relevant to Human Rights and Community Relations (HRCR), or not. 
This is done via a supervised machine learning algorithm using pre-coded data.
The articles that were classified as relevant to HRCR were then given a sentiment score based on
how positive, negative, or neutral their language was towards the topic
